      In considering the devastation in the two cities, it should be remembered
      that the cities' differences in shape and topography resulted in great
      differences in the damages. Hiroshima was all on low, flat ground, and was
      roughly circular in shape; Nagasaki was much cut up by hills and mountain
      spurs, with no regularity to its shape.

    <p>
      In Hiroshima almost everything up to about one mile from X was completely
      destroyed, except for a small number (about 50) of heavily reinforced
      concrete buildings, most of which were specially designed to withstand
      earthquake shock, which were not collapsed by the blast; most of these
      buildings had their interiors completely gutted, and all windows, doors,
      sashes, and frames ripped out.
